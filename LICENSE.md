123test API - Software Development Kit License Agreement
BACKGROUND. 123test B.V. ("us," "our" or "we") has developed a set of Application Programming Interfaces and related technology called the "Software Development Kit" (the "API/SDK") in connection with our proprietary products and services hereafter named "123test". Pursuant to the terms of this License Agreement ("Agreement"), you ("Licensee") may use the API/SDK to create plug-ins and associated applications that interact with and enhance the use of 123test. By using the API/SDK and/or its accompanying manuals, samples and examples (the "Documentation"), you agree with 123test B.V. to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein.

In addition to the terms of this Agreement, you may also be bound by the 123test End User License Agreement and any additional Terms of Use for 123test and any related applications or web sites. If there is any conflict between the terms of another agreement and this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control with respect to your use of the API/SDK and the other agreement shall take precedence with respect to the subject matter of such other agreement.

THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, including the rights and license granted in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, 123test B.V. and Licensee agree as follows:

DESCRIPTION AND USE
1.1 123test API / Software Development Kit. The 123test API/SDK consists of specific programmatic APIs, interface definitions, generated code libraries and associated tools, which allows you to create software plug-ins or applications that work along with 123test to read, write, update, or delete certain content from 123test libraries (databases). Functionality may also be developed to augment certain existing capabilities of 123test and to facilitate enhanced work flows between 123test and other third-party applications. Plug-ins or applications developed using the API/SDK may be integrated into the 123test interface or into a third-party application, or may be separate, stand-alone applications provided they meet all requirements set forth in this Agreement.

1.2 Responsibility Regarding Work Product. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you are entitled to use and share with third parties any plug-in, application, tool or other work product developed with the API/SDK that enhances the experience of 123test users ("Work Product"); however, you may not commercially license or distribute the Work Product unless you have formally alerted 123test B.V. of your intent and obtained 123test B.V.'s written approval. You are solely responsible for any Work Product that you develop and release. You hereby agree that you will make your Work Product available only to end users that have agreed to the following terms in connection with their use of the Work Product: (i) end users may not create derivative works based on any portion of your Work Product; (ii) end users may not provide services for a fee using your Work Product; (iii) end users may not commercially distribute your Work Product; and (iv) end users may not use your Work Product for any illegal or injurious purpose. You further agree that you will not grant end users any rights with respect to your Work Product that are inconsistent, or in conflict, with the terms set forth herein.

1.3 Prohibited Uses. Without limiting other restrictions in this Agreement, you agree that (i) the API/SDK may not be used to create Work Product that (a) offers or promotes services that may be damaging to, disparaging of or otherwise detrimental to 123test or its licensors, licensees, affiliates and partners, (b) transfers, displays or uses content or functionality from 123test without creating additional and distinct benefit(s) for 123test users, (c) competes with 123test in any commercial or non-commercial market; and (ii) the API/SDK and Work Product may not be used with demo versions of 123test other than for short-term testing and evaluation purposes.

1.4 API/SDK Modifications. 123test B.V. reserves the right to modify the API/SDK, and to release subsequent versions. You may be required to use the most recent version of the API/SDK in order to obtain functionality for associated plug-ins and applications. The API/SDK is currently provided free of charge, but 123test B.V. reserves the right to charge for the API/SDK (or additional features or functionality thereof) in the future.

1.5 Use of Work Product. You agree to provide 123test B.V. with access to your Work Product. Regardless of whether the Work Product is integrated into a third-party application, or created as a separate, stand-alone application, a free, courtesy copy (or free log-in access) will be provided to 123test B.V. promptly upon request by 123test B.V. In consideration of the rights granted by 123test B.V. herein, you hereby grant to us a fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to: (i) use, reproduce, perform and display your Work Product for our business purposes; (ii) link to and direct users to such Work Product; and (iii) sublicense the foregoing rights to our affiliates or any third parties that are working with us as development partners, hosting facilities or in similar capacities in order to enable them to perform their services.
