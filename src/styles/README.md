# API Styles

All test items and reports follow a single format. This makes it possible to alter the appearance of tests and reports when embedded in existing websites.

We offer the raw SASS files so that you can inspect the existing themes or create a custom new theme.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Compiling

```
npm run minify
```

Builds the SASS and creates minified css files in the /dist directory.
